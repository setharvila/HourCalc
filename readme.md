# HourCalc
Have you ever been in a situation where you know you need to work a set number of hours at the end of the week before you need to clock out? HourCalc solves this exact problem. In order to use HourCalc, you will need the following information:
- Hours already worked this week
- Hours desired
- Time you clocked in  

When supplied with that information, HourCalc will let you know what time you need to clock out.

## Background
I worked a summer job where I was permitted to work up to 39.99 hours in a week. I was not to work beyond 40 hours. I could schedule out the days to clock in at a certian time and clock out at a certian time each day and I would hit the hours goal, but it got close sometimes. Often I found myself arriving to work early or staying late and that added time to my hours. Trying to do the math in a hurry to figure out what time I needed to clock out just wasn't working. Thats why I built HourCalc.

### Important Notes
- While I personally rely on the calcuations, I bare no responsibilty that the calculations will be accurate. The program has not been fully tested or optimized to work in every use case. Use at your own risk.
- When supplied with a floating point number for the clock in time, the seconds are truncated, not rounded. Be mindful of that when calculating your time.
